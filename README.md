# Blue's Generic Serializer

A general purpose automatic serializer that performs just as fast as manual serialization, at the expense of initial load time.

It is made with `Networking` as the main use case, but can be used for other things as well.

The goal is to eliminate the possibility of human error & to boost productivity.

*Disclaimer: This is still work in progress, it is considered to be in a `PRE-ALPHA` state.*


## Getting Started

1. Clone or download.
